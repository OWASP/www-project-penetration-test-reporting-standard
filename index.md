## Overview

The OWASP Penetration Test Reporting Standard (OPTRS) addresses the inconsistency in penetration test reports, where thousands of companies generate reports in different formats, making it difficult to integrate findings into security workflows.  

By defining a structured, JSON-based format, OPTRS ensures that penetration test results are:  

- **Consistent**. Standardized format for easy comparison across engagements.  
- **Machine-readable**. Facilitates integration with SIEMs, vulnerability management tools, and automation workflows.  
- **Actionable**. Findings are structured for better remediation tracking and risk prioritization.  

## Why OPTRS?  

Without a standard, security teams face:  

- **Disparate reporting formats**, leading to confusion and delays in addressing vulnerabilities.  
- **Lack of automation**, requiring manual effort to extract insights from reports.  
- **Poor interoperability**, making it hard to integrate findings into vulnerability management platforms.  

OPTRS solves this by providing a universal format that simplifies security operations and accelerates risk mitigation.  

## Roadmap  

The development of OPTRS follows a structured, community-driven approach.  

### 1. Research and Development  
- Gather industry insights on best practices in penetration testing and reporting.  
- Collaborate with security professionals, penetration testers, and organisations to define essential reporting elements.  

### 2. Drafting the Standard  
- Develop a JSON-based schema for penetration test reports.  
- Create templates and guidelines for structuring findings, risk ratings, and remediation steps.  

### 3. Community Feedback and Review  
- Engage the OWASP community and industry experts for feedback.  
- Refine the standard based on real-world usability and adoption challenges.  

### 4. Standardization and Advocacy  
- Publish the final version of OPTRS on OWASP.  
- Work with security vendors, penetration testing firms, and industry bodies such as CREST International to drive adoption.  
- Promote awareness through conferences, webinars, and security meetups.  

### 5. Ongoing Maintenance and Updates  
- Establish a governance process for continuous improvement.  
- Regularly update the standard to reflect changes in penetration testing methodologies.  

## Current Progress  

A structured JSON schema for penetration test reports has been developed, with:  

- Clear categorization of findings  
- Automation-ready format  
- Interoperability with security tools
