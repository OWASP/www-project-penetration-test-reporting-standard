# OWASP Penetration Test Reporting Standard (OPTRS)

## Overview  

The **OWASP Penetration Test Reporting Standard (OPTRS)** provides a **structured, machine-readable JSON format** for penetration test reports.  

### Why OPTRS?  

Penetration testing reports often lack **consistency, automation capabilities, and interoperability** across security tools. OPTRS solves this by:  

- **Standardizing report structures** for better comparability  
- **Enabling automation** with a JSON-based format  
- **Improving interoperability** between security teams, SIEMs, and vulnerability management tools  
- **Providing clear, actionable insights** for faster remediation  

## Schema  

The OPTRS JSON schema defines a **structured format for penetration test reports**, ensuring that findings are:  

- **Categorized properly**  
- **Easily ingested by security tools**  
- **Machine-readable for automation workflows**

## Roadmap  

The OPTRS development follows a structured, community-driven approach.  

### ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Research and Development** (*Completed*)  
- Industry research and collaboration with penetration testing professionals  

### ‚úÖ **Phase 2: Drafting the Standard** (*Completed*)  
- Development of the OPTRS JSON schema and reporting structure  

### ‚è≥ **Phase 3: Community Feedback and Review** (*Current Phase*)  
- Open feedback from penetration testers, security teams, and OWASP contributors  

### üöÄ **Phase 4: Standardization and Advocacy** (*Upcoming*)  
- Official OWASP publication and industry adoption efforts  

### üîÑ **Phase 5: Ongoing Maintenance and Updates** (*Planned*)  
- Continuous updates based on industry changes and feedback  

## How to Use OPTRS  

1. **Adopt the Schema:** Use OPTRS as the format for penetration test reports.  
2. **Integrate with Security Tools:** Automate ingestion into SIEMs, vulnerability management platforms, or custom dashboards.  
3. **Contribute Feedback:** Help refine the standard by sharing feedback.  

## Get Involved  

We encourage security professionals, penetration testers, and developers to:  

- **Provide feedback** on the schema  
- **Adopt OPTRS** in security assessments  
- **Contribute to development and integrations**
